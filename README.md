If you want to run the application you will need to download the .zip file and then navigate to the 'code' folder and run 'Colour picker.exe' to open it,
Due to it being coded in pygame, I couldn't find any other ways of creating a demo. 
If it seems laggy, it is normal due to the methods used to draw the colour picker.
